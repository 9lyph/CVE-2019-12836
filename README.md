#### Vulnerability Details

JEditor v3.0.5 allows for upload of files of various file extension types, one of which is '.HTML'. 

JEditor formulates a Content-Disposition HTTP Response Header that, in its default configuration 'Content-Disposition: inline', allows for content to be displayed and rendered within the context of a users browser.

This allows an attacker to forge a request, which does not comply with Same Origin Policy restrictions, on behalf of any authenticated user.

This vulnerability may allow an attack to Steal Sensitive Session details, possibly leading to a Session Hijack.
