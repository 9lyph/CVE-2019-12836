#### Affected Product Code Base

JEditor - WYSIWYG Editor for Jira - v3.0.5

#### Affected Component

JEditor v3.0.5

#### Description

The Bobronix JEditor editor before v3.0.6 for Jira allows an attacker to add a URL/Link (to an existing issue) that can cause forgery of a request to an out-of-origin domain.  This in turn may allow for a forged request that can be invoked in the context of an authenticated user, leading to stealing of session tokens and account takeover.

JEditor v3.0.5 allows for upload of files of various file extension types, one of which is '.HTML'. JEditor is utilised by JIRA for its file upload functionality. Using this functionality an attacker is able to upload malicious content.

Once the malicious content is uploaded a subsequent request can be made for the content which allows for the inline displaying and rendering of the content within the context of any authenticated user's browser. This may allow for an attacker to forge a  malicious request, on behalf of any authenticated user. 

#### Vulnerability Type

Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
